# Wine-Api


I created this API to maintain a database of popular wines.

I was looking for an API to use with other apps I am working on, however I could not find an API to suit my needs, so I built one.

This API connects to a Mongo DB of wines.  It can add / delete wines, as well as search for wines by winery, vintage and wine_id
